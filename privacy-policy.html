                governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities

                Like most website operators, menopausalrelief.onrender.com
                collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
                web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
                browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
                and time of each visitor request.
                menopausalrelief.onrender.com's purpose in collecting
                non-personally identifying information is to better understand
                how menopausalrelief.onrender.com's visitors use its website.
                From time to time, menopausalrelief.onrender.com may release
                non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
                by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
              </div>
              <div><br /></div>
              <div>
                menopausalrelief.onrender.com also collects potentially
                personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on
                https://menopausalrelief.onrender.com blog posts.
                menopausalrelief.onrender.com only discloses logged in user and
                commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses
                and discloses personally-identifying information as described
                below.
              </div>

              <div>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</div>
              <div>
                Certain visitors to menopausalrelief.onrender.com's websites
                choose to interact with menopausalrelief.onrender.com in ways
                that require menopausalrelief.onrender.com to gather
                personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
                information that menopausalrelief.onrender.com gathers depend on
                the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
                sign up for a blog at https://menopausalrelief.onrender.com to
                provide a username and email address.
